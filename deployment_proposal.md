# PII Detection and Redaction Solution Deployment Proposal

## Proposed Architecture

Our solution proposes deploying the PII Detector & Redactor as a **Sidecar container** within the existing Kubernetes pod architecture. Each application pod that handles data streams containing sensitive information will have a dedicated sidecar container running our Python script. This sidecar will act as a transparent proxy, intercepting and sanitizing data before it's processed by the main application container.

### Justification

This deployment strategy is chosen for its significant advantages in addressing the key constraints of latency, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of integration.

* **Scalability:** By using a sidecar pattern, our solution scales automatically with the application. As Kubernetes scales the number of application pods to handle increased traffic, a new instance of our PII detector sidecar is created with each pod. This ensures that the PII detection capability scales horizontally to meet demand without requiring a separate, centralized service.

* **Latency:** The sidecar model minimizes latency by keeping the PII detection process local to the application pod. The data does not need to be routed to an external service or API, which eliminates network overhead and reduces the time it takes to sanitize the data stream in real-time. This is critical for a "Real-time PII Defense" challenge.

* **Cost-Effectiveness:** This approach leverages the existing Kubernetes infrastructure and resource allocation, avoiding the need to provision and manage a new, independent microservice. The sidecar containers are lightweight and share the network, storage, and host resources with the main application, leading to a more efficient use of resources and lower operational costs.

* **Ease of Integration:** Integration is streamlined as it only requires a change to the Kubernetes manifest (e.g., `Deployment.yaml`) to add the sidecar container definition. There are no changes required to the core application code itself. The solution is modular and can be easily added to or removed from any pod without disrupting the main application's logic.
